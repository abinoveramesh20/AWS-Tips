# 1. Expand the EBS Volume
# -------------------------

# Access the AWS Management Console and follow these steps:
# 1. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
# 2. Select the instance you want to expand.
# 3. Locate the EBS volume in the Storage section.
# 4. Modify the volume by increasing its size (e.g., from 8GB to 16GB).

# Note: Perform these steps in the AWS web interface.

# 2. Resize the Partition on the Instance
# ---------------------------------------

# Log in to your EC2 instance:
ssh ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip>

# Install 'cloud-guest-utils' if not already installed:
sudo apt-get install cloud-guest-utils

# Expand the partition to use the additional disk space:
sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1

# Resize the filesystem to utilize the expanded partition:
sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1

# 3. Verify the New Size
# ----------------------

# Check the updated disk size:
df -h

# 4. Reboot (Optional)
# ---------------------

# If the new size does not reflect, reboot the instance:
sudo reboot
